    Details: "-Fix player jump animations CHECK\n-Create a character control script
      to control player movement instead of using the virtual input manager (the
      virtual input manager will be used as a universal input manager) CHECK\n-Add
      a run/walk mode for the player to determine walk or run animation (no longer
      needed)\n-Toggle between walk and run speed and animations (CHECK)\n-Add ground
      detector for idle state (CHECK)\n-Perfect running state (CHECKED for now but
      will need feedback from teammates and playtesters well in the future)\n-Be
      able to jump while moving (CHECK)\n-Make sure player can move while falling
      (CHECK)\n-Double jump ability (CHECK but try using a blend tree to smoothen
      the ending animation)\n-Add ledge grab (CHECK but review for bugs)\n-Add player
      weapon (gun that shoots things depending on the environments you've been in)\n\t-for
      example, you will have the power to shoot ice beams if you've been in snowy
      environments, high-pressured water if you've been in lakes, flames if you've
      been around hot flamy volcanic regions, lightning bolts if you've been in deserts.\n-Make
      weapon repeatedly fire (use a coroutine)\n-Animation rigging (aim ik)\n-limit
      where the crosshair game object can go"
